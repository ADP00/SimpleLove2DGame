# SimpleLove2DGame
Simple game coded in lua with love2d.
Player controls a box with the arrow keys or wasd. Each time the player touches the circle a point is added.
This is my first test with lua and the love2d engine. All that is required to play are the game files placed in a folder and love2d installed on your computer.
